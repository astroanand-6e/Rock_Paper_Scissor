# Implement Rock, Paper, and Scissor game without the Mediapipe hand gesture detection.
- I want you to build the full website with Landing page with a call-to-action button which links to the game. (it has already been implemented, but I want you to give it a fresh look and change the landing page content as it mentioned webcam, show hand gesture and other things which are related to Mediapipe version of the game)
- Modify the current Landing page and update it to a simple rock, paper, scissors game with buttons instead of gesture detection.
- Modify the current Game page and make it consistent with UI/UX which were used in landing page. Make the Game page simple and easy to play.
